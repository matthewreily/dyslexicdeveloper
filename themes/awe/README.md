## AWE ##

[AWE] inspired by [Awesome] UI Kit which really looks beautiful and awesome.

Awesome UI kit from Freepik.com is massive and a fantastic way to ease into flat design. 
A great range of UI components are included: boxes, paginators, product ratings elements, blog elements, and all manner of e-commerce goodness.

Although Awesome UI Kit also provids HTML file, it seems like generated by some PSD2CSS tools. 
It isn't easy to scale, modify and reuse. But still a very useful design reference.

[AWE] use major design of Awesome Blog Elements, I pick some style and modify it to fit [Hexo]/[Hexi] theme. 
For me, it really looks cool. I think I'll integrate [Awesome] UI Kit into [bootstrap] framework for easier reuse, maybe.
