For you that do not know me, I am dyslexic and also a software developer.  I was diagnosed with dyslexia at the age of 7 after entering the public school system in Houston, Texas. Upon my diagnosis, I was placed "special education" classes from my arrival in 3rd grade to the middle of 5th grade.

What were my symptoms? I had a difficult time with reading and writing and it took me a lot longer to do both than the average student. Spelling has **ALWAYS** been difficult.

Reading and comprehension along with spelling is something I have had to work hard at. These difficulties made learning hard and I often rebelled against both learning and school.  Luckily I had the help of several wonderful teachers who encouraged me and showed me that I could achieve success in school. With their help I grew to love both reading and learning.  By my senior year in high school, I was a straight "A" student.

So why do I bring this up? I want to encourage anyone that has learning difficulties to not give up and know you can still be successful. For me, having dyslexia has forced me to work harder and gave me a love for achieving success in all areas of my life.  I now have a deep passion for learning and sharing knowledge with others.


*fun fact: I had 11 misspelled words in this post. There are probably a few more that spell-check did not catch :)*
