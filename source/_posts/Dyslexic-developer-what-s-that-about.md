For you that do not know, I am dyslexic and also a software developer.  I was informed that I suffer from dyslexia at the age of 7 upon entering the public school in Houston, Texas. Upon diagnosis, I was placed "special education" classes from my arrival in 3rd grade to the middle of 5th grade.

What were my symptoms? I had a difficult time with reading and writing and it took me a lot longer to do both than the average student. Spelling has **ALWAYS** been difficult.

Reading and comprehension along with spelling is something I had to work hard at. These difficulties made learning hard and I often rebelled against studying.

So why do I bring this up? I want to encourage anyone that has learning difficulties to not give up and know you can still be successful. For me, having dyslexia, has trained me to work harder and have a love for achieving success in all areas of my life.  I now have a deep passion for learning and sharing knowledge with others.


*fun fact: I had 11 misspelled words in this post. There are probably a few more that spell check did not catch :)*
