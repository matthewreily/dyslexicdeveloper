I am a pretty typical Microsoft developer when it comes to source control. I
spent a few years using CVS and Subversion. For the majority of my career however,
I have used Team Foundation Server.

I now find myself using Git more and more frequently. So this post and hopefully
more to follow, will be a place for me to document common tasks and workflows
as performed in Git.

###List of Git Commands -

###Creating and Retrieving Git Repositories
There are two commands associated with creating and retrieving Git Repositories

1. init - You can use the init command to initialize a directory as a Git repository.
This can be either an empty directory or an existing directory with pre-existing
files and folders.
