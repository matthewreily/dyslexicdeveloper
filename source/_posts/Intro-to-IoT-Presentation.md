This is the presentation details and material for a talk I have been giving under the title of "Into to Internet of Things"

### Abstract:

What is this IoT thing I keep hearing about? How can I get started making these “things”? If you have a
desire to tinker with stuff and make them blink, move, and respond to physical inputs plus love you some
.NET, then this talk is for you. We will go over what IoT is and how you can use your .NET skills to get
started immediately.
We will discuss the Netduino device and what it can do. This talk will also give a quick intro into Azure
websites and how we can leverage them in our devices. We will also go into a brief discussion of the .NET
micro framework and some of the limitations you might encounter.
This talk will include several demos of projects using the .NET micro framework, Netduino devices, and
Azure services.
